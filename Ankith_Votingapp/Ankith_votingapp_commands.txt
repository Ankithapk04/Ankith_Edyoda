4)**Voting App**

-> cd $home (root)
-> kubectl delete all --all
-> git clone  https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app

// Checking the repos
-> ls
-> cd example-voting-app
-> cd k8s-specifications
-> ls 
-> vi vote-service.yaml
 	Nodeport : 31002 (changing the nodeport in voteservice.yaml)
	:wq ( to save and exit ) 
-> vi result-service.yaml
	Nodeport : 31003 (changing the nodeport in resultservice.yaml)
	:wq ( to save and exit ) 
-> kubectl apply -f . ( Creating all the pods)

// Opening my application to vote and check results
// publicIP: 31002 ( Voteapp Browser ) 
// publicIP: 31003 ( resultapp Browser )

***Voting successfully done*** 

// View all the pods
-> kubectl get po 

Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.

// Deleting the Votepod
-> kubectl delete po vote
( Successfully delete VotePod, It is creating new pod due to replica set )

// Deleting the Workerpod
-> kubectl delete po WorkerPod
( Successfully delete workerPod, It is creating new pod due to replica set )

// Deleting the DBpod
-> kubectl delete po DBpod
( Successfully delete DBpod )

what happens after db pod deletion?
// I observed that the Data stored is deleted in DB
// The voting captured data is deleted
// So, No votes found..

// Now Voting newly in order to made the result Pod work again. 
// Voting successfully done 
// New Votes is been recorded
